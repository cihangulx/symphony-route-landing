      "routing": {
        "question": "How does multi-provider routing work?",

      },
      "failover": {
        "question": "What happens if a provider goes down?",

      "existingProviders": {
        "question": "Can I use my existing SMS provider accounts?",
        "answer": "SymphonyRoute works with your existing provider accounts. Simply add your API credentials, and we'll start routing through them immediately. You maintain full control over your provider relationships."
      },
      "integration": {
        "question": "How long does integration take?",
        "answer": "Most developers are up and running within 15 minutes. Our RESTful API is designed to be familiar and intuitive, and we provide SDKs for JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Go, and PHP."
      },
